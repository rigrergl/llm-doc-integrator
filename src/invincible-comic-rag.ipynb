Since Nolan isn\\'t around, the responsibility falls to Mark, his next of kin. Mark is worried that they want to execute him, but the law is actually that he must marry their queen.

After the battle, the couple then makes love as part of the ceremony (in front of everyone) to bond their love before their subjects.\\nWhile explaining this last part Lethan becomes upset and walks off. It turns out Lethan is in love with Aquaria. Mark explains that Lethan should be with her, that he\\'s only doing the ceremony to keep the Atlanteans happy.
