Nolan reveals that the Viltrumites achieved a perfect society, but not without killing off the weak from their planet. Cutting the population in half, they emerged unbeatable warrior race. Afterwards, a planetary empire was established and was agreed upon unanimously. Nolan expanded on Viltrumite history by explaining the planet conquering process. First, a planet was searched for and founded. They would set up an orbit monitor to see their conquered planet. He revealed that those who accepted takeover would be given Viltrumite technology to help their way of life. Those who resisted would be killed off until they submitted. Seeing it as successful, the Viltrumites double their efforts in conquering planets.\\n\\nThey would begin to use enslaved aliens to conquer planets to avoid overusing Viltrumites. Not long after Nolan was born, he then would accept a job to help find planets, but would be eager to prove himself. Nolan would then audition and finally prove himself worthy of conquering planets. Nolan would conquer several planets and soon lead his own unit. The Viltrumites would destroy an one-eyed alien race civilization. Nolan would be awarded for his planet conquering. As they continue conquering planets, a new strategy was devised to make up for their ranks being stretched too thin. Taking advantage of their long life spans, the World Conquering Committee would send Viltrumites to planets to survey, weaken, and prepare for Viltrumite rule. Nolan would was assigned to Earth and left for it.
